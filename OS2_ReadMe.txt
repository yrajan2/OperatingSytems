Please read this file first before using the CPP file.

Introduction:
This assignment is a work of RAJAN Yaqzaan and JAIN Jai Jitendra both of whose SIDs are in the file name.

How to Compile the CPP File:
Save the file with a shorter file name such as OS.cpp [For Convenience]
In the terminal write the following command to compile the file:

g++ OS.cpp -lreadline -o OS

How to Run the File:
In order to run the file, save the demo.cpp file in the same folder as OS.cpp.
Feel free to rename the demo file to any other name.
Copies of the demo file with different names will also work fine.
Then compile the demo file using the command below:

g++ demo.cpp -o demo

To run the compiled OS.cpp, type "./OS" in the terminal.
A prompt (BP> ) will be shown.

Now all the test cases can be tried. We have added comments in the CPP file for better understanding of our code.
Feel free to contact us via yrajan2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk or jjjjain2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk for any confusions or clarifications.

Happy Testing!!!!
